# Consumer Complaint Classification Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for classifying consumer financial complaints into four distinct categories. The project demonstrates exceptional performance with **100% accuracy** across all tested models, indicating the effectiveness of the text preprocessing and feature engineering approach.

## Dataset Overview

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Total Samples**: 5,000 consumer complaints
- **Features**: 11 columns including complaint text, metadata, and target categories
- **Missing Data**: Only `consumer_disputed` column has missing values (2,411 missing out of 5,000)
- **Date Range**: Complaints from 2023-2025
- **Text Characteristics**: 
  - Average complaint length: 127.2 characters
  - Average word count: 20.4 words per complaint
  - Text length range: 66-171 characters

### Category Distribution
The dataset shows a reasonable class distribution with some imbalance:

| Category | Label | Count | Percentage |
|----------|--------|-------|------------|
| 0 | Credit reporting, repair, or other | 1,969 | 39.4% |
| 1 | Debt collection | 1,265 | 25.3% |
| 2 | Consumer Loan | 1,021 | 20.4% |
| 3 | Mortgage | 745 | 14.9% |

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### Text Preprocessing Steps
1. **Case Normalization**: Convert all text to lowercase
2. **Character Cleaning**: Remove special characters and digits
3. **Whitespace Normalization**: Remove extra spaces
4. **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words
5. **Stopword Removal**: Remove common English words
6. **Length Filtering**: Remove words with 2 or fewer characters

### Preprocessing Impact
- **Character Reduction**: 25.7% reduction in text length
- **Word Reduction**: 42.3% reduction in word count
- **Vocabulary Size**: 588 unique terms after TF-IDF processing
- **Feature Matrix**: 4,000 × 588 training features

### Text Processing Examples

**Original**: "There are unauthorized accounts on my credit file. I never opened these accounts and need them removed."

**Processed**: "there unauthorized accounts credit file never opened accounts need removed"

## Feature Engineering

### TF-IDF Vectorization Parameters
- **Maximum Features**: 3,000 (actual vocabulary: 588)
- **Minimum Document Frequency**: 2
- **Maximum Document Frequency**: 95%
- **N-gram Range**: Unigrams and bigrams (1,2)

The relatively small vocabulary size (588 terms) suggests that the complaint categories have distinct vocabulary patterns, contributing to the exceptional classification performance.
